# STORE LOCATOR

This is a sample project that I learned for Nazariy Dumanskyy during his LIVE JavaScript Training


A store locator displays a set of markers representing locations on a map, to help users find the nearest location of a business they are interested in visiting. Store locators can also show related information such as operating hours, address, phone number, photos, and food menus. A store locator might also differentiate between locations based on various criteria, such as whether a particular product or service is offered.
